# TASK 1: replace the echo command that just says processing with a case statement that
#             recognizes the following command line options and tells the user if
#             they were found on the command line
#          Options to recognize: -h for help, -v for verbose mode
# TASK 2: add recognition of a debug option -d that expects a number that specifies the debug level (e.g. -d 3)
#             save the debug level in a variable to be available to use later in the script
#             display an error if the user gave the -d option without a number after it
# TASK 3: put anything that wasn't recognized on the command line into a variable for use later in the script
